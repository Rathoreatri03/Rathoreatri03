## 🔭 Current Projects
### 🚁 [RoboCop](https://github.com/Rathoreatri03)
An autonomous drone system aimed at improving **highway safety**. I'm working on **ML model training**, **GPS integration**, and **2D design** in collaboration with the Aerospace Department at Chandigarh University.

### 🛡️ [G.U.A.R.D.](https://github.com/Rathoreatri03)
A global **accident detection and prediction system** that ensures road safety through real-time monitoring. Leading the team as the **Team Leader**, I integrate hardware and software to create a seamless system. Won the **Best IEEE Award** at Vihaan 007!

### 🎮 [OCG: Object Control via Gestures](https://github.com/Rathoreatri03)
This system allows controlling objects through **hand gestures**, like turning on/off a fan or adjusting its speed. Worked on **dataset creation** and **Arduino/Python integration**. Showcased at Chandigarh University as a semester mini-project.

### 🧪 [Mycofibre: Sustainable Material Innovation](https://github.com/Rathoreatri03)
Developing sustainable materials using **hemp fiber**, **chitosan**, and other alternatives to traditional rubber and plastics. This project was showcased in various hackathons, including **Bihar Innovation Challenge** and **Vihaan 6.0**.

### 📊 [Body Hormone Analyzer (BHA)](https://github.com/Rathoreatri03)
Designed a device to provide hormone readings for medical professionals using **biosensors**. Showcased as the **group project of the semester**.
